# Calendar

This module will display any Views date field in calendar formats,
including date fields, node created or updated dates, etc. Switch between year,
month, and day views. Back and next navigation is provided for all views. Much
of the Calendar functionality comes from the Date module, part of core in
Backdrop.

See also Views iCal Export, needed to export dates using iCal feeds.
